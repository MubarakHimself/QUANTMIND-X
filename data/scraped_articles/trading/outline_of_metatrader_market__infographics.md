MetaTrader 5 / Trading


A few weeks ago we published [the infographic on Freelance service](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1038 "The Infographic on Freelance Service"). We also promised to reveal some statistics of the MetaTrader Market. Now, we invite you to examine the data we have gathered.

[MetaTrader Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "MetaTrader Market")
was officially released in February 2012. The store of trading
applications has come a long way since then. Initially the Market was
introduced in MetaTrader 5. Then, the Market section was also launched
for MetaTrader 4. The range of products has been expanded as well, from
offering trading applications to provide also [financial magazines](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "Financial Magazines in MetaTrader Market") and [books](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "Books in MetaTrader Magazine").

The evolution of the Market
increased the sales turnover: by July 2014, about 6 300 products worth a
total of more than $522,000 have been sold in the Market, while 520
sellers and 24 500 buyers have already passed through the application
store. This increase in sales has given rise to the emergence of the
significant number of successful developers making $10,000 or more per
month. Check the Market infographic below for more interesting statistical data on the Market service results.

Judging by the dates of comments, the topic is not relevant at all, as well as the transition to MT5...alas....

The very purchase of a [product](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/fundamental/economic_indicators_usa/usa_productivity "Productivity") is a cat in a bag...take Ebay as an example.

We are moving in the wrong direction...and statistics should be taken from the number of users who use MT4, there are millions of them,

and then it turns out that there are practically no real movements on the market...

Everything is known in comparison.

A different way and can not be, the seller himself does not know whether his robot will bring a profit tomorrow or not, yes, it is simply impossible to know, unless of course he is not selling a monkey, then he certainly knows how it ends :). Many newbies are guided by beautiful monitoring and a bunch of stars and rush to buy such robots.naturally, after one or two drained deposits they have confidence in the market, and actually to the platform itself begins to aspire to zero, and the seller at this time already launches another temporary-beautiful monitoring [on virtually](https://www.mql5.com/en/vps "Forex VPS for MetaTrader 4/5") the same robot, only slightly modified and with a different name and in a month he already has a bunch of stars from the allegedly real-raised on the robot grateful customers, in general carousel :). It is necessary on all labels of robots, which use in one form or another martingale or increasing risks in trading, to put warning signs of increased risk.(imho) It is one thing not to earn, and quite another thing to lose everything. People who lost everything will not want to return to the market and try something else.

**Stanislav Korotky:**

The statistics are good. Only the promotion of products is in trouble. There is no advertising rotator and it is not planned, as far as I understand. You can only search if you already know what you are looking for. Very often a person needs specific features, and the name is unimportant and unknown to him. But if, say, this person comes here to the forum and writes that he needs this and that, he can be sent (in a good sense, and sometimes in a bad sense) only to the codebase or to work. But it is forbidden to give a link to an already finished product that meets the requirements. It's not clear how it differs from work - there is exactly the same commercial background and one of the developers will earn money on the order by giving a commission to MK. So how is a commission on a product in the Marketplace worse than a commission on a job?

I agree

It is time to update the statistics.

This kind of market insight will attract new sellers and buyers.

As a retired journalist, I can publicise the new statistics if they are released now.

Good idea.

I'm curious how the market changed over the years.

Let's now shape the PHP-based Twitter idea which was introduced in the first part of this article. We are assembling the different parts of the SDSS. Regarding the client side of the system architecture, we are relying on the new MQL5 WebRequest() function for sending trading signals via HTTP.

So Why Would We Change It?"](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1045)

Let us reveal a little secret: MQL5.com website visitors spend most of their time on Johnpaul77 signal's page. It is a leader of our signal rating having about 900 subscribers with the total funds of $5.7 million on real accounts. We have interviewed the signal's providers. As it turned out, there are four of them! How are duties distributed among the team members? What technical tools do they use? Why do they call themselves John Paul? And finally, how have common gamers from Indonesia become providers of the top signal on MQL5.com? Find out all that in the article.

Developers of trading robots no longer need to market their services to traders that require Expert Advisors - as now they will find you. Already, thousands of traders place orders to MQL5 freelance developers, and pay for work in on MQL5.com. For 4 years, this service facilitated three thousand traders to pay for more than 10 000 jobs performed. And the activity of traders and developers is constantly growing!

On the occasion of the MQL5 Freelance Service fourth birthday, we have prepared an info-graphic demonstrating the service results for the entire time of its existence. The figures speak for themselves: more than 10 000 orders worth about $600,000 in total have been executed to date, while 3 000 customers and 300 developers have already used the service.
