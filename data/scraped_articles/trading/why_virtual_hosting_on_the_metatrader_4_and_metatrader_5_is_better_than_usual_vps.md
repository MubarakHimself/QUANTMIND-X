MetaTrader 5 / Examples


Renting a virtual server right from the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 terminals is the optimal way to ensure uninterrupted work of your trading robots and [Signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=MQL5.community&utm_source=Article+About+Virtual_Hosting_vs_VPS "Copy successful traders' deals with Signals in MetaTrader") subscriptions. Essentially, it is an analogue of a VPS though it is better and more suitable for addressing needs and challenges that a trader comes across. The server can be rented straight from your MetaTrader. It takes only a couple mouse clicks for Experts Advisors, indicators, scripts together with Signal subscriptions and settings to be transferred to the virtual server. The Virtual Hosting Cloud network was developed [specially for MetaTrader](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/36899?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=MQL5.community&utm_source=Article+About+Virtual_Hosting_vs_VPS "The MetaTrader 4 platform update to build 735: virtual hosting and improved news feed") and has all the advantages of a native solution.

Certainly, there are alternatives to virtual hosting but a closer look reveals that they do not compete. The first thing that comes to mind is using a home computer as a budget option. It could work, however a stable internet connection and uninterrupted power supply are not guaranteed. A VPS can be rented from a suitable provider found on the internet. That could be feasible but it implies a manual search for a server having minimum latency with the required Forex-broker's. Such a puzzle does not suit everyone.

### Virtual server + your MetaTrader = powerful engine "all in one" for autonomous trade of your robots

As automated trading and copy trading develop, virtual hosting becomes irreplaceable. There is no other way of achieving consistent around the clock work of trading robots and subscriptions to successful traders' signals. Native virtual hosting ideally suits for launching any trading robots in the MetaTrader terminals regardless of whether you wrote them yourself, bought them on the Market or commissioned third party developers in the Freelance. Rather, the robots bought in the [Program Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=MQL5.community&utm_source=Article+About+Virtual_Hosting_vs_VPS "Market of trading applications for MetaTrader - Expert Advisors, indicators, scripts, financial journals and books") have an additional advantage. The number of allowed installations does not change unlike when launching licensed products on a usual VPS.

If you do not trade with Experts but actively use signals and copy other traders' deals, you will see that virtual hosting offers all you need. It guarantees uninterrupted work of all your subscriptions. Only with MetaTrader, can you with just one click obtain a correctly configured and ready terminal located on the server of your choice ensuring a minimum latency with your trader.

### A virtual server ensures minimum network delays

One of the most important advantages of the virtual hosting over ordinary VPS is the proximity of our servers to the brokers' trading servers. It brings down to the minimum the network delays at trading operations. VPS servers can be located anywhere as they are designed for a wide range of tasks and are not customized for work with brokers' servers. Even specialized Forex VPS services usually have 1 or 2 server locations, which do not cover all brokers.

![Virtual Hosting Wizard](https://c.mql5.com/2/12/Virtual_Hosting_Wizad_01_en.png)

If you rent a standard VPS, you will need to find suitable types of servers yourself through trial and error. It is a waste of time and money, which does not guarantee that the rented VPS will have low latency to the broker's trading server. Virtual hosting in MetaTrader is good enough to stop this fruitless search. Rent a virtual server straight from your terminal and compare it with an ordinary VPS. You have a free 24 hours that you can either use continuously or break them down.

### It is as simple as ABC because the virtual terminal does not require installation nor setting up

Another advantage of the virtual hosting is simplicity of launching a terminal. You do not need to install or set the terminal up.

The virtual terminal was created specially for work in the virtual hosting network and receives all settings right from your terminal after manual synchronization. Just start your MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5, open required charts and symbols, launch indicators and Experts, specify the terminal settings and you are ready for automated trading. Now all you need to do is to rent a virtual server from your MetaTrader and [perform migration](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/994 "How to migrate a trading account to virtual hosting").

![Rent a virtual server right in your MetaTrader terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/12/screen_zoom__2.png)

Renting a server is very easy and managing it does not take any effort. Starting, stopping, canceling hosting and control over usage of the virtual server resource are immediately available from MetaTrader. For that, a fully subscribed trading account Navigator features an icon with the location name and the state of the virtual server. Simply call the context menu and when you click on "Details" you will get the control and management dialog window.

![Full control over trading account migration and sybchronization](https://c.mql5.com/2/12/collage_virtual_hosting_en.gif)

There you can start and stop a terminal copy, synchronize the client terminal current environment with the virtual one and view the charts of processor resource utilization as well as disk space and RAM. It must be emphasized that migration of your charts, launched robots and indicators as well as parameters of copying trades are performed only per your request. This way you have full control over transferring your launched robots and signal subscriptions as there is no automatic synchronization of the client terminal and the virtual one.

### This is why virtual hosting in MetaTrader 4/5 is better than standard VPS

Summing up:

1. Creating a terminal copy is very simple and you can do it right in your MetaTrader platform.
2. You can easily rent a server with minimal network delays to your broker's trading server.

3. You can control the work of the virtual terminal right from your client terminal connected to the relevant trading account.

4. The rent fee is deducted automatically - in the [MQL5.community payment system](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/302 "MQL5.community Payment System") or from your trading account.

5. You can test the virtual hosting in a 24-hours' free trial period.

Trading with MetaTrader, it is truly logical to rent a virtual server right from the terminal.

Are you still in doubt? Rent a virtual server right now, launch a virtual terminal and check out the advantages of the native hosting!

[Virtual hosting](https://www.mql5.com/en/vps "Forex VPS for MetaTrader 4/5") in MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platforms is not better, but much worse than regular VPS - because there is a limit of 32 charts. And the support service is practically non-existent

Rules of virtual hosting: III.2. One leased terminal can work only with one trading account of the user. - [https:](https://www.mql5.com/en/vps/rules#part_III)//www.mql5.com/en/vps/rules#part\_III

Yeah, now.

In these rules it is written:

"A single trading account can be used on several Virtual terminals. There are no limitations on this parameter."

TRANSLATION: Onetradingaccountcan beusedonseveralvirtualterminals.There are norestrictionsonthisparameter.

But how to connect this trading account to several terminals - nobody on the planet Earth knows.

And the support service is silent on this matter.

So make conclusions after that, how much this particular VPS is "better" than all the others.

I believe the answer would be to use multiple _MQL5 Community_ accounts, one for each _MetaQuotes VPS_, but that would be a violation of the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.mql5.com/en/about/terms) — _[#12](https://www.mql5.com/en/about/terms#part_12)_ _.13\.

Neither in the description nor in the advertisement of this service I did not see any text about this limitation.

Perhaps when using this VPS there are some other footnotes in small print?

Where can I read them?
