and [how to become a signal provider](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/591 "How to Become a Signals Provider for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5") in our service. Due to the growing

Signals Service is, and demonstrates in great detail how to subscribe to trade signals and how to become a signal

Maybe your broker doesn't support signals, or the signal you are trying to copy is currently unavailable for subscription (this happens when there is a larger than 30% open drawdown).

The article introduces a structure for an Expert Advisor that trades multiple symbols and uses several trading systems simultaneously. If you already identified the optimal input parameters for all your EAs and got good backtesting results for each of them separately, ask yourself what results you would get if testing all EAs simultaneously, with all your strategies put together.

![Testing and Optimization of Expert Advisors](https://c.mql5.com/2/17/824_37.gif)[Testing and Optimization of Expert Advisors](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1385)

The article provides a detailed description of the process of testing and optimizing Expert Advisors in the MetaTrader 4 Strategy Tester. The importance of such information and the need for this publication cannot be underestimated. A lot of users who only get started with the MetaTrader 4 trading platform have a very vague idea of what and how needs to be done when working with Expert Advisors. The proposed article gives simple and clear answers to all of these questions and provides a slightly more professional approach to handling these issues using a specific example.

![Indicator for Kagi Charting](https://c.mql5.com/2/0/LOGO.png)[Indicator for Kagi Charting](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/772)

The article proposes Kagi chart indicator with various charting options and additional functions. Also, indicator charting principle and its MQL5 implementation features are considered. The most popular cases of its implementation in trading are displayed - Yin/Yang exchange strategy, pushing away from the trend line and consistently increasing "shoulders"/decreasing "waists".

In this article, the author continues to familiarize the readers with the Lite\_EXPERT2.mqh functions using real Expert Advisor implementation examples. The article deals with the idea of using floating pending orders and pending orders that vary dynamically from deal to deal which are determined based on Average True Range (ATR) indicator values.
