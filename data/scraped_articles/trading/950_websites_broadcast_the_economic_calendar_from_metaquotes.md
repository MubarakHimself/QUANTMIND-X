**Andrei Fandeev:**

Do search engines index the content of this widget?

Let me rephrase the question in another way: does the placement of MQ widgets raise the [ranking](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_characteristics/matrix_rank " MQL5 Documentation: function Rank") of the site, in the "eyes" of the search engine?

**Vasiliy Sokolov:**

Let me rephrase the question differently: does the placement of MQ widgets raises the rating of the site, in the "eyes" of the search engine?

I consulted the experts.

No, it is not indexed, and therefore does not raise the site [ranking](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/matrix/matrix_characteristics/matrix_rank " MQL5 Documentation: function Rank").

BUT - if the visitor will click on something on the widget, it will give an increase in the Behavioural factor, which is no less important than unique content.

Comparing several time series during a technical analysis is a quite common task that requires appropriate tools. In this article, I suggest developing a tool for graphical analysis and detecting correlations between two or more time series.

The article deals with the algorithm of developing stock indicators based on real volumes using the CopyTicks() and CopyTicksRange() functions. Some subtle aspects of developing such indicators, as well as their operation in real time and in the strategy tester are also described.

When developing trading algorithms, we often encounter a problem: how to determine where a trend/flat begins and ends? In this article, we try to create a universal indicator, in which we try to combine signals for different types of strategies. We will try to simplify the process of obtaining trade signals in an expert as much as possible. An example of combining several indicators in one will be given.
