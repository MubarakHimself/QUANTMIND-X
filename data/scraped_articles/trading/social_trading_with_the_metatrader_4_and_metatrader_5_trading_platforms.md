MetaTrader 5 / Trading


What is social trading? It is a mutually beneficial cooperation
of traders and investors whereby successful traders allow monitoring of
their trading and potential investors take the opportunity to monitor
their performance and copy trades of those who look more promising.

You monitor real-time trading of a number of traders, connect to the
most successful ones and copy their trades in automatic mode - that's
what social trading is about. For novice and inexperienced traders who
have just turned to financial markets for additional income, it is
probably the best opportunity to actually start trading.

You do not need to be a professional trader with a great bundle of
knowledge and skills in order to trade professionally. Nor do you need
to follow and analyze the news from financial markets, work out and
implement trading strategies and be prepared to change the ones that
fail to keep monitoring their performance in the new market conditions.
Thanks to social trading it all becomes unnecessary since you can simply
copy trades of all those who follow the news, analyze markets and
create profitable strategies.

Is it difficult to start mirror trading and how much does it take?
While hedge fund investing was not available to many due to high entry
threshold (hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars), social
trading is a highly affordable system available to absolutely any trader
with any income level. It opens up access to a large market with vast
opportunities that you, too, can use.

Social trading advantages are obvious:

- Additional income for both traders and investors

- Investment diversification

- Opportunity to connect to the most successful traders and automatically mirror their trades
- Low entry threshold: you can start with a minimum budget
- Practice opportunities: you can trade on [demo accounts](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/mt4/demo "MetaTrader 4 demo accounts trading signals") in a training mode
- Time saving
- High operability and user-friendly interface

Ready
to take the opportunities offered by social trading but don't know
where to start? [MetaTrader 4](https://www.metatrader4.com/ "MetaTrader 4 Trading Platform") and [MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/ "MetaTrader 5 Trading Platform") are the most famous and
popular platforms for social and mirror trading, with [Trading Signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals for MetaTrader")
service being a very convenient, advanced social trading feature
offered in these platforms. Social trading with the MetaTrader platforms
is very straightforward: the user chooses the signal directly in the
terminal, subscribes to it and from that moment on all trades are copied
in his account.

![Trading Signals with Automatic Execution on Your Account](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/signals_welcome__1.png)

[Social trading with MetaTrader](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Social Trading with MetaTrader") will allow you to monitor trading
activity and profitability of successful traders, and most importantly,
copy their trades. If you see a positive trend in performance of one of
the traders whose signal is available for subscription, go ahead with it
and start copying his trades. The trading terminal will automatically
mirror all trades of the signals provider in your account, without any
manual intervention necessary.

So, after subscribing the trader can earn money using the Signals service, without effort, skills or trading experience.

After all, social trading should be simple and straightforward to be
easily understood by traders with any background. We cannot but admit
it. In this light, MetaTrader trading signals appear to be perfectly
adequate. They are available to any user, regardless of their trading
experience. Here, you are not required to sign an agreement with a
provider of the selected signal or a broker, nor is there any paperwork
or manual control necessary. Everything is done automatically.

All you need is to specify your broker and enter the number of your account on
the broker's server. Nothing more than that. Subscription process will
take very little time. The description of a step-by-step subscription
procedure is available in the article entitled ["How to Subscribe to Trading Signals"](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/523 "How to Subscribe to Trading Signals"). After reading it, you will subscribe to the signal of your choice quickly and easily.

![How to Subscribe to Trading Signals](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/subscribe_to_signals_welcome__2.png)

Despite being seemingly complicated, choosing a provider of the suitable signal has been made as simple as possible - the [Trading Signals section](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals)
features a regularly updated list of providers. By default, signals
on the list are sorted by quality ensuring that top positions are taken
by signals with higher credibility and better financial performance.
However, for your convenience trading signals can also be sorted by
monthly growth, number of subscribers, price and other parameters.

Social trading with the MetaTrader trading platforms is easy,
straightforward and available to everyone. Out of thousands of available
signals providers, you just need to choose the one that suits you more
and measures up to your parameters!

3 Steps to Trade Major News Events(based on [dailyfx article](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/post_of_the_day/2014/06/06/3-Steps-to-Trade-Major-News-Events.html "http://www.dailyfx.com/forex/education/trading_tips/post_of_the_day/2014/06/06/3-Steps-to-Trade-Major-News-Events.html"))

Talking Points:

- News releases can be stressful on traders
- Develop a plan before the event arrives

Major news releases can be stressful on traders. That stress can show up for a variety of trading styles.

Perhaps you are already in a good position with a good entry and you are afraid the news release may take a bite out of your good entry.

Perhaps you want to enter into a new position as prices are near a technically sound entry point, but you are uncertain if the technical picture will hold up through the volatile release. Therefore, you agonize over the decision of whether to enter now or after the news event.

Maybe, you like to be in the action and initiating new positions during the release. The fast paced volatility during the news release still gets makes your palms sweat as you place trades.

As you can see, news events stress traders in a variety of ways.

Today, we are going to cover three steps to trade news events.

![](https://c.mql5.com/3/40/news1.png)

**Step 1 - Have a Strategy**

It sounds simple, yet the emotion of the release can easily draw us off course. We see prices moving quickly in a straight line and are afraid to miss out or afraid to lose the gains we have been sitting on. Therefore, we make an emotional decision and act.

Having a strategy doesn’t have to be complicated. Remember, staying out of the market during news and doing nothing is a strategy.

A strategy for the trader with a floating profit entering the news event could be as simple as “I am going to close off half my position and move my stop loss to better than break even.”

For the trader wanting to initiate a new position that is technically based, they may decide to wait until at least 15 minutes after the release, then decide if the set-up is still valid.

The active news trader may realize they need a plan of buy and sell rules because they trade based on what ‘feels good.’

**Step 2 - Use Conservative Leverage**

If you are in the market when the news is released, make sure you are implementing conservative amounts of leverage. We don’t know where the prices may go and during releases, prices tend to move fast. Therefore, de-emphasize the influence of each trade on your account equity by using low amounts of leverage.

Our Traits of Successful Traders research found that traders who implement less than ten times effective leverage tend to be more profitable on average.

![](https://c.mql5.com/3/40/news2.png)

**3 - Don’t Deviate from the Strategy**

If you have taken the time to think about a strategy from step number one and if you have realized the importance of being conservatively levered, then you are 90% of the way there! However, this last 10% can arguably be the most difficult. Whatever your plan is, stick to it!

If I put together a plan to lose 20 pounds of body weight that includes eating healthier and exercising, but I continue to eat high fat and sugar foods with limited exercise, then I am only setting myself up for frustration.

You don’t have to be stressed or frustrated through fundamental news releases.

The simplicity of this business is apparent.

A certain amount of knowledge in [FOREX trading](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/mobile-trading "Mobile Trading Platform MetaTrader 5") is required.

I read this at [https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/subscriptions](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/subscriptions)

\\_\\_\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the future, the Trusted Execution Token technology will be implemented, which allows copying subscription trading operations to a signal

**even when the MetaTrader terminal is closed**.

\-\-\--------------------------------

So soon trading signals will work even when you sleep ;-).

![Graphical Control of External Parameters of Indicators](https://c.mql5.com/2/17/807_6.gif)[Graphical Control of External Parameters of Indicators](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1370)

External variables of indicators are controlled using a special window where parameters can be changed and the indicator is then run again. The obvious inconvenience of these manipulations has given rise to the need for displaying the required parameters on the screen and controlling the indicator graphically.

Successfully operating for 1.5 years, MQL5 Market has become the largest traders' store of trading strategies and technical indicators. It offers around 800 trading applications provided by 350 developers from around the world. Over 100.000 trading programs have already been purchased and downloaded by traders to their MetaTrader 5 terminals.

In this article, we will create a pattern that uses a single set of parameters for optimization of a trading system, while allowing for unlimited number of parameters. The list of symbols will be created in a standard text file (\*.txt). Input parameters for each symbol will also be stored in files. This way we will be able to circumvent the restriction of the terminal on the number of input parameters of an Expert Advisor.

It's not just simple; it's super simple. Testing Expert Advisors on non-standard time frames is possible! All we need to do is to replace standard time frame data with non-standard time frame data. Furthermore, we can even test Expert Advisors that use data from several non-standard time frames.
