MetaTrader 5 / Trading


Do you want to offer your [trading signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals) and make profit? Register on MQL5.com website as a Seller, specify your trading account and offer traders a subscription to copy your trades. The solution is simple, while the efforts are minimized.

- **Access to a huge audience**

The entire market of millions of [MetaTrader 4](https://www.metatrader4.com/ "MetaTrader 4") and [MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/ "MetaTrader 5") users is at your fingertips. You will receive direct access to your potential subscribers.

- **Built-in trade copying system**

The Signals service is built directly into the MetaTrader platform. Copying trades does not require any additional tools or settings. Subscribing to signals is easy and convenient. You do not have to worry about technical issues and support.

- **Payment support**

The service provides a ready-made mechanism allowing you to securely accept payments for your signals. The system supports credit cards and popular payment wallets. The payment, minus the service fee, is made to the seller's internal account, from which the money can be conveniently withdrawn at any time. The service also supports auto renewal of subscriptions.


### Register as a Seller

Complete a simple registration procedure to get the Seller status. The registration is fully automatic and takes no more than five minutes.

Please tell me why the message "Confirm your phone number to [become a seller](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/401 "Article: Why Is MQL5 Market the Best Place for Selling Trading Strategies and Technical Indicators ")" appears when I create a signal. How do I receive the code? I've entered my number in my profile, but I don't know it anymore.

To be able to create a signal you need to first register as a seller. Signals can only be created on real accounts, not demo nor cent accounts. Please read the instructions on the [Signal rules](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/rules).

Also, if you are unable to receive confirmation on your mobile phone, you may need to find an alternative service provider. To change the number, contact the [service desk](https://www.mql5.com/en/contact), and follow the instructions.

Buying a trading robot on MQL5 Market has a distinct benefit over all other similar options - an automated system offered can be thoroughly tested directly in the MetaTrader 5 terminal. Before buying, an Expert Advisor can and should be carefully run in all unfavorable modes in the built-in Strategy Tester to get a complete grasp of the system.

Is it really necessary to be a programmer to develop trading robots? Do we need to spend years monitoring price charts to be able to "feel" the market? All these issues have been discussed in our interview with Dmitry Terentew (SAFF), whose trading robot has been occupying the first page of the Championship from the very beginning.
