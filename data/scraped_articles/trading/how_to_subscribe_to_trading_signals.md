![Trading Signals in MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 ](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/signals_welcome.png)

### How to Choose a Signal

The service provides a huge number of signals for subscription. How to choose the most appropriate one?

**Rating**

To help users choose the best signals, we compile a rating of signals based on various criteria. Top ranked signals show up first in the list. And vice versa, low rated signals are hidden from the Showcase on the site and in trading terminals to protect subscribers from poor-quality strategies.

**Selection of Signals with the Best Conditions**

The showcase of signals provides a special function for selecting signals with the most suitable conditions for copying. Users just need to specify the name of the server, on which their trading account is open. The system will pick up signals with the best matching settings of trading instruments and the lowest slippage.

![Selecting signals with the best conditions](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_1__2.png)

**Warning**

When selecting a signal, make sure to carefully analyze the entire complex of trade reports. Pay attention to the warnings that are displayed on the signal page.

![Warnings on the Signal page](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_2__3.png)

**Sorting and Filtering**

To select signals based on specific criteria, use the sorting and filtering functions.

![Sorting and Filtering](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_3__2.png)

**A Showcase of Signals in MetaTrader and Favorites**

Traders can select signals and subscribe to them directly from the MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 terminals.

![A Showcase of Signals in MetaTrader, adding to Favorites](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_favorites__2.png)

Click on the column headers to sort the signals accordingly - by growth, drawdown, number of subscribers, etc.

A few signals matching the selected criteria can be found on the list. Add them to Favorites, so you can easily get back to them later and evaluate once again. Click on the star on the list or on the signal page, and the selected signal will appear on a separate tab "Favorites".

### How to subscribe to a Signal

Subscribing to a signal is easy. Two accounts are needed: a MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 trading account and an [MQL5.community](https://www.mql5.com/) account.

To subscribe to paid signals, [enough money](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/302) should be available on the user's MQL5.community account.

Go to the trading terminal settings and specify the MQL5 account in the "Community" tab:

![Configuring connection to MQL5.community in the trading terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_5.png)

Now you can subscribe to the signal either directly from the trading terminal or on the MQL5.com site.

**Subscribing from a Terminal**

Select a signal in the Showcase. Subscription can be selected directly in the list or on the signal details page. Click "Subscribe..." and confirm subscription in the appeared window.

![Subscribing to signals from the trading terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_6.png)

Check all the subscription parameters and pay special attention to the warnings (if any) of mismatching trading conditions. It is recommended to use signals with similar trading conditions.

To continue subscription, agree to [the terms of use of the Signals service](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/rules) and specify the MQL5.community password to confirm subscription. After this, a window of copying parameters will open.

![Signal Copy Settings](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/en_7.png)

If necessary, change the settings. After a click on "OK" trade copying will start.

If you can't find the desired signal in the Showcase of Signals in your terminal, use the built-in search system.

**How to Subscribe on the Site**

Open the Signal page and click "Subscribe". If the trade platform is not installed on your PC, click "download it here" link in the window that appears. The official [MetaTrader 4](https://www.metatrader4.com/ "https://www.metatrader4.com/") or [MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/en "https://www.metatrader5.com/en") site will open, where the terminal can be downloaded and installed. Otherwise click "Start copying in MetaTrader". The trading terminal will open. The selected signal page will open in the terminal, and the subscription confirmation window will appear. Subscription is completed from the terminal as described above.

Hello. My subscriber does not have trades copied. Notifications about open and closed deals are received. It says "symbol not found". Please provide a link to a tutorial on this topic, if there is such a link

This may be due to the fact that some symbols do not pass mapping, e.g. -

Yes, I have Xauusd+. Subscriber has just Xauusd. Am I correct that copying is not possible in this case?

Yes, I have Xauusd+. The subscriber just has Xauusd. Is it correct that copying in this case is impossible?

Copying in this case is possible - if all other conditions of mapping are met.

But there are other factors affecting mapping, for example (from FAQ):

[GOLD instrument is traded on Provider's account, my broker has the same instrument, but it is called XAUUSD. In this case will the trades on the symbol GOLD be copied to the symbol XAUUSD?](https://www.mql5.com/ru/forum/10603#q13)

For each remaining instrument the margin calculation type is checked - if the Forex type is checked , the instrument is passed on. Instruments with CFD, Futures, etc. calculation type are discarded.
If after the checks there is no instrument left or more than one instrument is found, it is considered that the comparison failed and copying of Provider's trades on this instrument is impossible.

\-\-\--------------------

What does it mean?

- It means that if you have more than one symbol on XAUUSD - then copying is impossible.
- And if in the symbol specification the margin calculation is not Forex, then copying is also impossible.

\-\-\-------------------

There are cases when all the conditions of mapping are met, but the broker itself limits copying (and it is written about it in the Metatrader log for this symbol. Such cases are very rare (but the last case was a few days ago with XAUUSD and XAUEUR).

That is, in most cases it is mapping.

I advise you to check your broker for mapping of copied symbols after selecting the copying signal, i.e. whether it will be copied or not, and then sign up:

It was on Friday of the Championship's first week that the trading robot of Andrey Barinov (Wahoo) occupied the fifth place in TOP-10. Andrey is a newcomer in the Championship but he has already managed to execute more than 100 orders in Jobs and develop a dozen of products for Market. We have arranged an interview with him and learned that the development of a "simple multicurrency Expert Advisor" is not an easy but a fairly easy task.

Many developers face the same problem - how to get to the trading terminal sandbox without using unsafe DLLs. One of the easiest and safest method is to use standard Named Pipes that work as normal file operations. They allow you to organize interprocessor client-server communication between programs. Take a look at practical examples in C++ and MQL5 that include server, client, data exchange between them and performance benchmark.
