MetaTrader 5 / Trading


We are pleased to announce that MetaTrader 5 now features [Trading Signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals in MetaTrader 5"),
thus giving a powerful tool to investors and managers. While you are
following the trades of a successful trader, the terminal will be
automatically reproducing them in your account!

![Trading Signals in MetaTrader 5](https://c.mql5.com/2/4/Signals_logo.png)

The [MetaTrader 5](https://download.mql5.com/cdn/web/metaquotes.software.corp/mt5/mt5setup.exe "Download MetaTrader 5")
terminal is continuously evolving as new functions and options are
added. And Trading Signals represent yet another important feature
offered to traders. The standard function allowing to automatically copy
trades of another trader is now available to all MetaTrader 5 users.
This is a ready-made simpler solution for those who are used to
investing in others or managing someone else's funds.

The use of the Trading Signals in MetaTrader 5 is made as simple as
possible. In addition, the paperwork required to document relations
between investor and manager is eliminated altogether and all risks are
minimized. There are virtually no settings as such and signals from your
signals supplier are handled automatically.

It takes almost nothing to start using the MetaTrader 5 Trading Signals:

1. **Make an account on MQL5.com.**




![Make an account on MQL5.com](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/522_en_1.png)

2. **Deposit a small amount of money in any way convenient to you.**






![Deposit a small amount of money](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/522_en_2.png)

3. **Enter your MQL5.com account details directly in the terminal.**


![Enter your MQL5.com account details directly in the terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/522_en_3.png)

4. **And subscribe to a signal you like.**




![Subscribe to a signal you like](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/522_en_4.png)


From that moment on, your terminal will start receiving trading
signals of the signals supplier you selected. And you are just one small
step away from being able to automatically reproduce all trades - the
function should be enabled in the settings!

![Trading Signals Settings](https://c.mql5.com/2/11/522_en_5.png)

Your terminal can now make money without you knowing it. You only
need to have an active subscription and ensure that your terminal is
connected. However the future versions will only require subscription
without the need to connect the terminal.

So if you have been seeking for the possibility to trust your money
to be managed by a successful trader, consider using Trading Signals in
MetaTrader 5, being the easiest available solution. Or else, if you are a
successful trader willing to share your trading signals, you are most
welcome to [MQL5.com](https://www.mql5.com/ "MQL5.community").
Register as a signals supplier to consistently earn extra profit!

The MetaTrader 5 Trading Signals imply simplicity, convenience and profits.

Hi Eleni.

Thank you for your good advise. Please help below.

I mistakenly subscribed to a signal on my demo account. I intended to subscribe on my real account. I have not bought the VPS and I have also not yet migrated the signal. I have read that I can move my subscription to my real account, but this can only happen once a week. So my question is, do I have to finish setting up the signal in my demo account before moving it to my real account? Also, what would happen if I just hit unsubscribe on my demo account? Will I receive my 30 dollars back into my MQL5 account or once its subscribed its gone?

Also, the [signal provider](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2599 "Article: Working with sockets in MQL, or How to become a signal provider ") advised that we should use his broker for exact results and better copying. So is it possible to move the subscription to an entirely different broker on a real account? Please help. Service desk are yet to respond.

If you mean your trading account money, contact your broker.

It was on Friday of the Championship's first week that the trading robot of Andrey Barinov (Wahoo) occupied the fifth place in TOP-10. Andrey is a newcomer in the Championship but he has already managed to execute more than 100 orders in Jobs and develop a dozen of products for Market. We have arranged an interview with him and learned that the development of a "simple multicurrency Expert Advisor" is not an easy but a fairly easy task.

Today we are going to talk with Rogério Figurelli (figurelli), a regular participant from Brazil that has not missed any Automated Trading Championship since 2007. This year, he also began to sell his Championship's Expert Advisor in the Market along with his other products. Rogério believes that MetaTrader 5 platform certification on the largest Brazilian exchange BM&FBOVESPA will reveal new professional developers and traders, who do not yet know the full potential of robot investors.

Select any of the thousands of signal providers, subscribe in a few clicks and the provider's trades will be copied on your account.

Throughout the entire duration of the Automated Trading Championship 2012, we will be providing live coverage of the events - hot reports and interviews every week. This report spotlights Achmad Hidayat (achidayat), the participant from Indonesia. On the first day of the Championship his Expert Advisor secured its position in the third ten, which is a good start. Achmad has sparked our interest with his active participation in the MQL5 Market. He has already published over 20 products thus far.
