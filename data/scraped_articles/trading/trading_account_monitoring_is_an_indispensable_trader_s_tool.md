MetaTrader 5 / Trading


Trading account monitoring provides a detailed report on all completed deals. Trading statistics are collected automatically and are provided by the means of easy-to-understand diagrams and graphs. Growth dynamics, transaction histories, trading instrument distribution, percentages of loss-making and profitable trades and deposit loads, are just some of the monitoring parameters at your disposal, which are available after enabling the trading account monitoring.

To start working with the service, [create your personal signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/new?utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_medium=article&utm_term=trading.signals&utm_content=create.new.signal&utm_campaign=210.en.trading.signals "Create your personal signal") on MQL5.com.

It is a [demo account](https://www.mql5.com/en/docs/constants/environment_state/accountinformation#enum_account_trade_mode "MQL5 documentation: Account Properties"), but it is inevitably waiting for an update and is an invalid account.

Sorry, I will email you again as I think I had the wrong originating email address earlier.

I'm waiting for an update.

I downloaded MT4 first and the specs were a little different from what everyone else was using, so I uninstalled it and downloaded the specs again.

I uninstalled it once and re-downloaded the specs that everyone else was using.

The login ID and password were changed, but as a result, I found out later that I created two accounts.

Is that the reason why I can no longer use it?

I specified MT5 by mistake.

I thought I had requested MT4 ...

I want to cancel MT5.

What should I do?
