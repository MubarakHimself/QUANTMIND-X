MetaTrader 5 / Trading


[Trading Signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals")
service recently introduced in MetaTrader 5 allows traders to copy
trading operations of any signals provider. Users can select any signal,
subscribe to it and all deals will be copied at their accounts. Signals
providers can set their subscription prices and receive a fixed monthly
fee from their subscribers.

#### What Is So Special About MQL5 Signals?

- **It is a simple and ready-made solution**. Subscription is
performed in a few clicks. All deals are copied automatically without
trader's intervention. Signals providers will also be able to start
easily – it will take less than a minute to add a signal to the base and set a subscription fee.

- **High security for all the participants**. Careful
selection is performed among signals providers – they work in a test
mode within a month. If the test is passed, they can [offer their signals on MQL5.com](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals").

- **Subscription and signals purchase rate**. No agreements
between subscribers and providers are required. Signals providers put
their products up for sale while subscribers choose the most suitable
ones. That's all. There is no excessive bureaucracy. There is no tedious
work with bunches of papers – all processes are performed strictly
inside the system avoiding any kind of paperwork.

- **Signal subscription can be purchased easily**. If you are interested in any signal available for a paid subscription, you can subscribe to it easily. [Multiple payment systems](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/302 "MQL5.com Payment Systems") supported by MQL5.com simplify the process greatly. WebMoney, PayPal, bank card – select any payment method you like!

- **No commission**. Signals service does not charge commission from the subscriber's traded volume.

- **Access to the largest financial market**. Signals providers
gain access to all MetaTrader 5 users. All traders using the trading
platform in their activity can choose and quickly subscribe to any
signal available in their terminals

Because MQ is neutral in this case and is not comparing one [signal provider](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2599 "Article: Working with sockets in MQL, or How to become a signal provider ") against another

I think signalanalysisreportinMQL5still inadequate,lackof informationcanbe misleading, especiallyforbeginnersfollower.

as SignalProvider, he must beable tomanageinvestors/followersmoney,notjustmakehighprofitsandthe next dayto losemoney quickly.

One way ofprevent thisis toput the"[Stop Loss](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/trading/general_concept "User Guide: Types of orders")"level.

Maybe, in report systemshouldbe addedwarningsignal,for example,"SignalProvidersat higher riskfor notusingSL" or "placementSLunreasonable" for SL too wide.

"I examined many indicators before realizing that they are not necessary for making money on Forex" - our present interviewee Egidijus Bockus (Egidijus) told us boldly. We have all reasons to take his words seriously, as his Expert Advisor occupies the third place with more than $32 000 beginning from the third week of the Automated Trading Championship 2012.

![Interview with Matúš German (ATC 2012)](https://c.mql5.com/2/0/Matus_German_interview__1.png)[Interview with Matúš German (ATC 2012)](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/580)

It's the second time Matúš German participates in the Automated Trading Championship. By the end of the fourth week of ATC 2012 his Expert Advisor has been holding its positions in the TOP-10 having about $30 000. Matúš is from Slovakia, from the little town Bardejov. Matúš is interested in trading for about 5 years and he develops Expert Advisors for 3 years already.

What can be more complicated than a multicurrency trading robot? Surely, it is an automated strategy based on Elliott Wave Principle. Can we imagine something more complicated than that? Yes, we can. It is a multicurrency Expert Advisor using Elliott Waves on each currency pair! Alexander Prishchenko (Crucian) believes that even a newcomer can learn the rules.
