**Vitaly Muzichenko:**

When I started forex trading, my brother came to me, and I started to show him how to make money on the market.

I sat there talking about how to make money on the market, saying, "If it crosses, we buy, and if it does, we sell.

Anyway, he was listening, and then he said: "Brother, show me the money".

You see, if the most beautiful and fancy product does not bring profit, and the product without any interface does, then to hell with the beauty and other tinsel!

If you are right, you don't need to prove it to me. After all, I will be punished for my naivety by the lack of interest to my work.

**Tetyana Shcherba:**

Can you explain in a nutshell **why for free**? Don't you want to get an adequate appreciation of your labour? Where does this altruism come from?

Altruism and adequate evaluation do not contradict each other, but help. I want to give a base, and on top of that base will be paid offerings. Without a base there will be no interest, and without interest there will be no space for new offers.

I'm not complaining, but it's just strange that after sales the utility didn't go up at least 1 of 10000 steps, that's why I asked. I'm thinking about the price too by the way.

right now in the top (1 page) for 4k there is a [product](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/terminal/help/fundamental/economic_indicators_usa/usa_productivity "Productivity") with a price of 10. so the hypothesis with a small price is cancelled.

I've already raised the price, but unfortunately nothing has changed. Perhaps recalculation of ratings from the beginning of the month, or maybe it's just me so "lucky" :)

Although of course it is very interesting why 4 sales in a row did not move the utility in the rating at all.

No, recalculation is conditionally every half an hour, hour, maybe more often, maybe less often, but not much. a sale in the rating is taken into account within an hour / several hours.

I don't know where to address on this issue, but it is possible that the problem is with your particular product and it may be necessary to directly intervene with the [service developers](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1100 "Article: How We Developed the MetaTrader Trading Signals Service and Social Trading in General ").

The article describes custom methods for assessing the trading history. Two classes have been written for downloading and analyzing history. The first of them collects the trading history and represents it as a summary table. The second one deals with statistics: it calculates a number of variables and builds charts for a more efficient evaluation of trading results.

When developing trading algorithms, we often encounter a problem: how to determine where a trend/flat begins and ends? In this article, we try to create a universal indicator, in which we try to combine signals for different types of strategies. We will try to simplify the process of obtaining trade signals in an expert as much as possible. An example of combining several indicators in one will be given.

This is the second part of the article showing the development of a multi-symbol signal Expert Advisor for manual trading. We have already created the graphical interface. It is now time to connect it with the program's functionality.
