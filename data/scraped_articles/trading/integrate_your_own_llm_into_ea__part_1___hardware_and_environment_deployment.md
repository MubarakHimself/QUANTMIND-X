### What Is the LLMs

**1\. About LLMS**

LLMs (large language models) are fundamental models that utilize deep learning in natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. To help them learn the complexity and connections of language, large language models are pre-trained on large amounts of data. LLM is essentially a neural network based on a Transformer (Don't ask me what Transformer is, haven't you heard of " Attention is All You Need "?).By LLMs, we mainly refer to open-source models, such as LLama2. Like OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT is powerful, but it can't take advantage of our personalized data. Of course, they can also be integrated with algorithmic trading, but that is not what this series of articles is about.

**2. Why and How to Apply LLMs to Algorithmic Trading**

Why did we choose LLMS? The reason is simple: they have strong logical understanding and reasoning skills. So here's the problem, how can we use this powerful capability in algorithmic trading? As a simple example, what would you do if you want to make an algorithmic trading by using the Fibonacci sequence? If you implement it with traditional programming methods, it's a brutal thing. But if we use LLMs, we only need to make the corresponding data set according to Fibonacci theory, and then use this data set to fine-tune the LLMs, and directly call the results generated by LLMs in our algorithmic trading. Everything just got easier.

**3\. Why Deployment LLMs Locally**

1). Local deployment can provide higher data security. For some applications involving sensitive information, such as medical, financial and other fields, data security is crucial. By deploying LLMs in a local environment, we can ensure that data does not leave our control range.

2). Local deployment can provide higher performance. By choosing the appropriate hardware configuration, we can optimize the running efficiency of the model according to our needs. In addition, the network latency in the local environment is usually lower than that in the cloud environment, which is very important for some applications that require real-time response.

3). By deploying LLMs in a local environment and fine-tuning them according to our personalized data, we can get a model that better meets our needs. This is because each application scenario has its uniqueness, and through fine-tuning, we can make the model better adapt to our application scenario.

In summary, local deployment of LLMs can not only provide higher data security and performance but also allow us to get a model that better meets our needs. Therefore, understanding how to deploy LLMs in a local environment and fine-tune them according to our personalized data is very important for how we integrate into algorithmic trading. In the following content, we will detail how to choose hardware configuration and build software environment.

### Hardware Configuration

When deploying LLMs locally, hardware configuration is a very important part. Here we mainly discuss mainstream PCs, and do not discuss MacOS and other niche products.

The products used to deploy LLMs mainly involve CPU, GPU, memory, and storage devices. Among them, the CPU and GPU are the main computing devices for running models, and memory and storage devices are used to store models and data.

The correct hardware configuration can not only ensure the running efficiency of the model but also affect the performance of the model to a certain extent. Therefore, we need to choose the appropriate hardware configuration according to our needs and budget.

**1\. Processor**

Currently, due to the emergence of frameworks like Llama.cpp, language models can be directly inferred or trained on CPUs. So if you don't have a standalone graphics card, don't worry, the CPU is also an option for you.

At present, the main processor brands on the market are Intel and AMD. Intel's Xeon series and AMD's EPYC series are currently the most popular server-level processors. These processors have high frequency, multi-core, and large cache, which are very suitable for running large language models (LLMs).

When choosing a processor, we need to consider its number of cores, frequency, and cache size. Generally speaking, processors with more cores, higher frequency, and larger cache perform better, but they are also more expensive. Therefore, we need to choose according to our own budget and needs.

For local deployment of LLMs, we recommend the following hardware configuration:

CPU: At least 4 cores with a frequency of at least 2.5GHz

The following is the current CPU market situation for reference:

![cpu](https://c.mql5.com/2/58/cpu.png)

You can find more information in here: [Pass Mark CPU Benchmarks](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html%23cpuvalue "https://www.cpubenchmark.net/laptop.html#cpuvalue")

**2\. Graphics Card**

For running large language models (LLMs), graphics cards are very important. The computing power and memory size of the graphics card directly affect the training and inference speed of the model. Generally speaking, graphics cards with stronger computing power and larger memory perform better, but they are also more expensive.

NVIDIA's Tesla and Quadro series as well as AMD's Radeon Pro series are currently the most popular professional graphics cards. These graphics cards have a large amount of memory and powerful parallel computing capabilities that can effectively accelerate model training and inference.

For local deployment of LLMs, we recommend the following hardware configuration:

Graphics card with 8G or more memory.

The following is the current GPU market situation for reference:

![gpuy](https://c.mql5.com/2/58/gpu.png)

You can find more information in here:  [Pass Mark Software - Video Card (GPU) Benchmarks](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html "https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html")

**3\. Memory**

DDR5 has become mainstream. For running large language models (LLMs), we recommend using as much memory as possible.

For local deployment of LLMs, we recommend the following hardware configuration:

At least 16GB of DDR4 memory.

**4\. Storage**

The speed and capacity of storage devices directly affect data reading speed and data storage capacity. Generally speaking, storage devices with faster speed and larger capacity perform better but are also more expensive.

Solid State Drives (SSDs) have become mainstream storage devices due to their high speed and low latency. NVMe interface SSDs are gradually replacing SATA interface SSDs due to their higher speed. Solid State Drives (SSDs) have become mainstream storage devices due to their high speed and low latency.

For local deployment of LLMs, we recommend the following hardware configuration:

At least 1TB NVMe SSD.

### Software Environment Configuration

**1\. Building and Analysis of Different Operating System Environments**

When deploying LLMs locally, we need to consider the choice of operating system environment. Currently, the most common operating system environments include Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Each operating system has its own advantages and disadvantages, and we need to choose according to our own needs.

**\- Windows:**

The Windows operating system is loved by a large number of users because of its user-friendly interface and rich software support. However, due to its closed-source nature, Windows may not be as good as Linux and MacOS in some advanced features and customization.

**\- MacOS:**

The MacOS operating system is loved by many professional users for its elegant design and excellent performance. However, due to its hardware restrictions, MacOS may not be suitable for users who need to perform large-scale computing.

**\- Windows + WSL:**

WSL allows us to run a Linux environment on the Windows operating system, which allows us to enjoy the user-friendly interface of Windows while using the powerful command line tools of Linux.

The above is our simple analysis of different operating system environments. We strongly recommend using Windows + WSL, which can take care of daily use and serve our professional computing.

**2\. Related Software Configuration**

After choosing the appropriate hardware configuration, we need to install and configure some necessary software on the operating system. These softwires include the operating system, programming language environment, development tools, etc. Here are some common software configuration steps:

**\- Operating System:**

First, we need to install an operating system. For training and inference of large language models (LLMs), we recommend using the Linux operating system because it provides powerful command line tools and a highly customizable environment.

**\- Programming Language Environment:**

We need to install the Python environment because most LLMs are developed using Python. We recommend using Anaconda to manage the Python environment because it can easily install and manage Python packages.

**\- Development Tools:**

We need to install some development tools such as text editors (such as VS Code or Sublime Text), version control tools (such as Git), etc.

**\- LLMs Related Software:**

We need to install some software related to LLMs such as TensorFlow or PyTorch deep learning frameworks, as well as Hugging Face's Transformers library etc.

**3\. Recommended Configuration**

Here are some recommended software tools and versions:

**\- Operating System:**

We recommend using Windows11+Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (WSL). This is a stable and widely used Linux distribution with a rich package and good community support.

**\- Python Environment:**

We recommend using Anaconda to manage the Python environment. Anaconda is a popular Python data science platform that can easily install and manage Python packages. We recommend using Python 3.10 because it is a stable and widely supported version.
