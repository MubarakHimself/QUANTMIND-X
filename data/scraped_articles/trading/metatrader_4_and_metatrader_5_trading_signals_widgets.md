Now, you should only copy the generated code and paste it on your web page. From this point on, the selected widget will be displayed on the page among other information. After clicking the block, your visitors will be able to view the page about your trading signal containing its full description, as well as subscribe to it.

If you decided to display TOP 10 on your web page and selected the appropriate option in [Widgets](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals/widgets "Trading signals widgets for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5") section, you should specify the platform: MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5.

**server:**

You mean I needed to highlight like this to make it clear what you are being asked? :)

And where are you in the widgets **for signals** **bbCode**?

You first give one screenshot from signals, where you advise to click on the button to get **bbCode**. And then in the next post you give a screenshot for getting **bbCode** from the [product in the marketplace](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/385 "Article: How to Post a Product in the Market "). Are you confused about widgets or what? ))

If there was an affiliate scheme and links, it would be much more useful and popular.

The link to your own signal can be designed independently at your discretion, especially since you can insert the same block on the site with an arbitrary figure of profitability and graph.
