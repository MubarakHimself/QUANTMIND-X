MetaTrader 5 / Trading


This summer we have launched a [new \\
affiliate program](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/12638 "New Reward Scheme for Attracting Users ") to help MQL5.community members promote their products and signals. However, it is beneficial not only for [MetaTrader \\
Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "A Market of Applications for the MetaTrader 5 and MetaTrader 4") sellers and paid [trading \\
signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals with Automatic Execution on Your Account") providers but also for common users. Now, you do not have to write Market applications on your own or sell subscription to your
signals to make money on MQL5.com. You can simply help promote these products and receive your profit share.

It is pretty simple:

1. You place a web link/widget to MetaTrader Market application or a trading signal on any website.

2. A user clicks you web link and buys that application or subscribes to the trading signals.

3. The profit share set by the application's seller or the signals provider is transferred to your account.

![Share the link, attract buyers and get your profit share](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/3steps_eng.png)

Now, let's examine this in more details accompanied by screenshots:

So, you have entered MQL5.com website and you want to
make money here. You can do this by participating in the affiliate program and promoting products/signals of the community members. Select
a product/signal, move to its description page and find a text block specifying a profit share in percentage terms (if a profit share is not
specified, a payoff is not provided by a seller).

1. ![Find a text block  specifying a profit share in percentage terms](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/share_signal_en.png)![Find a text block  specifying a profit share in percentage terms](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/share_market_en.png)

2. Copy the specially generated web link from that text block

or a widget code by clicking "Get a widget code":



![Get a Widget Code](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/signal_widget_en.gif)

3. Share the copied web link via social networks, forums, blogs and your personal website



![Share the copied web link via Twitter](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/share_tweet_en.png)





![Share the copied web link via Facebook](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/share_fb_en.png)




or
    insert the widget code to your forum and blog messages or your website:



![Insert the Widget Code to Your Blog](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/share_blog_en.png)

4. The main thing is done. Now, you have to wait until an interested user clicks your web link/widget and purchases the application or
    subscribes to the trading signals. As soon as it happens, the specified profit share is transferred to your MQL5.com account.



![The specified profit  share is transferred to your MQL5.com account](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/payment_screen_en.png)


Suppose
    that the application's price is $100, and the seller has specified a payoff of 35% for an affiliate link. It means that you receive $35 for
    each buyer you attract. Let's assume that a monthly subscription to a signal costs $50 and a payoff is 10%. Then, you will receive $5 for
    each subscriber you attract.

As you can see, it is possible to start making money on MQL5.com right now without having to be a seller of [Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "A Market of Applications for the MetaTrader 5 and MetaTrader 4")
applications or a profitable [signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals "Trading Signals with Automatic Execution on Your Account") provider. Select the products you like and post links to them on various web resources. Attract potential customers and the
profit is yours!

### Affiliate program in Market and Signals to be closed

Due to low demand and incompatibility with the new MQL5.community services, the affiliate program is to be closed soon.

- Beginning from January 1, 2016, it will no longer be possible to set a partner payoff amount and register new affiliate links.
- Starting from April 1, 2016, no more payoff will be received by promoters for purchases made via affiliate links.

MQL5 Standard Library makes your life as a developer easier. Nevertheless, it does not implement all the needs of all developers in the world, so if you feel that you need some more custom stuff you can take a step further and extend. This article walks you through integrating MetaQuotes' Zig-Zag technical indicator into the Standard Library. We get inspired by MetaQuotes' design philosophy to achieve our goal.
