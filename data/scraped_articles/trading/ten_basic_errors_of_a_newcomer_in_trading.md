MetaTrader 4 / Trading


01. **Trading when market has just opened**




    Within the first several minutes after opening, the market usually
    moves about or jumps somewhere abruptly. Experienced traders sometimes
    try to use their knowledge to forecast by the first market movements
    what trend is possible. But emotions will certainly play tricks with a
    newcomer.

02. **Undue hurry in taking profit**




    Well, you opened a long position. Then, after a couple of days, you
    saw how much money you had earned and closed the position with joy. But
    this movement, as you would have gathered later, was just the beginning
    of a powerful up-trend. So, if you would not haste, you could earn 10
    times more money. Use TakeProfit orders only on extraordinary
    occasions, when the resistance level is clearly seen.
    Normally, it is better to exit the market using StopLoss and trailing
    stop.

03. **Adding lots in a losing position**




    This is a reverse example: you opened a long position, but price
    decreased. You doggedly insist on that "it would still grow, I just
    opened the position too early"
    and add by buying more lots. But the price goes on dropping and twices
    your losses. Remember: You should only add lots to a profitable
    position.

04. **Closing positions starting with the best one**




    If you have some long positions and the price starts to decrease,
    you often instinctively try to fix your profit first and only then
    close losing positions (or let it work until the StopLoss triggers).
    This is a wrong tactics: If the whole market decreases, those positions
    will most probably lose that
    have already been unprofitable. But you
    have already had losses on them. This means you should close them first
    of all. Better positions will not fall so rapidly and, in case of a
    reversal, they will go up again. So do not haste to close a profitable
    position.

05. **Revenge**




    A typical situation for a newcomer: A losing position has just been
    closed
    \- and he or she starts opening new positions enthusiastically to
    requite the wrongs. This will result in new losses, so do not return to
    trading immediately after having lost. Rest a little.

06. **The most preferable positions**




    Approach reasonably to your positions: Do not care especially for
    some of them, for example, for those where you bought at the lowest
    price - every trader is usually especially proud of such trades. It is
    clear that you are puffed up with self-admiration, but be careful and
    do not carry such a brilliant position to zero or even to minus.

07. **Trading by the principle of 'bought for ever'**




    You were working on a relatively short period of time, opened up,
    and prices went up tremendously. And you say to yourself: "Aha, I've
    caught the start of a many years' up-trend", and hang this position
    "for ever". But things do not just happen: you either change
    essentially for much longer estimation periods or keep standard rules
    on your standard short period. Rules that will make you enter and quit
    the market even if there is a really powerful trend. Do not "marry" your
    position!

08. **Closing of a profitable strategic position on the first day**




    Vice versa, if you trade not within a day, do not close a profitable
    position on the first day under no conditions. If even the price has
    been grown to a very high level, be patient: it can be higher tomorrow.

09. **Closing a position when alerted to open an opposite position**




    Many trade with systems of continuous entering the market. These
    systems are always "inside of a position". This means, closing of a
    long position means for them opening of a short one. One can use such
    positions, but they must be closed earlier: the signal to close must be
    of higher priority than the signal to open an opposite position.

10. **Doubts**




    You should not trade if you are not sure of your previous situation
    assessment. Having said to yourself "I'm sick with vague doubts", you
    should better close all your positions and reanalyze the situation. Or
    go for a walk. The latter recommendation is actual in all difficult
    cases, by the way. It helps for all diseases - try it yourself!

Are you going to write your own indicator? Perhaps you will find that what you need among indicators already embedded in the client terminal. So why to reinvent the wheel?
