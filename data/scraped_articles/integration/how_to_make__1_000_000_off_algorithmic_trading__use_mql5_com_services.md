MetaTrader 5 / Examples


Every novice trader dreams of steadily making a lot of money in the financial markets. How to do that without excessive risk and start-up budget? Where can a trader find the necessary information and get help from more experienced colleagues? MQL5 services provide unique profit opportunities for developers and traders from all over the globe, while beginners are able to find their own way in the world of algorithmic trading. These services are available to millions of traders directly from the MetaTrader trading terminal.

### Earn over $400,000 by selling Signals

Successful traders are able to make money not only from trading on their own accounts, but also from selling their trading signals. There are a lot of investors out there who do not have the required time or knowledge. Besides, investors want to maintain full control over their own trading account and are wary of entrusting their funds into the wrong hands. [Signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/signals?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=visit.signals.page) service allows copying the deals of experienced traders on a fixed subscription fee basis.

We recommend subscribing on a trading account opened at the same broker as the signal provider's one. This increases the accuracy of copying deals.

![Signal page](https://c.mql5.com/2/42/signal__2.png)

Each signal is accompanied by balance and drawdown charts, statistics, risk and slippage warnings, trading activity and distribution of trades by symbols. Such detailed data allows the [picking of suitable signals](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2704?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=learn.more) out of thousands offered in the Signals showcase. [Subscribe to a Signal](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/523?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=learn.more) and launch copy trading on a [built-in VPS](https://www.mql5.com/en/vps/manage-forex-vps?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=learn.more) without ever leaving the MetaTrader terminal.

![Signals showcase in the MetaTrader terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/41/2-showcase.png)

Millions of traders carry on their everyday activities via MetaTrader trading terminals, and they can choose your Signal to copy deals. We already have several Providers who have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars by simply broadcasting their trading via the Signals service.

![TOP 10 Signal Providers](https://c.mql5.com/2/42/Signals-all.jpg)

If your trade brings a stable income, then you can repeat their success even with a small deposit. Just create your Signal and register as a Seller. Selling Signals is one of the fastest and most affordable ways to make money while avoiding excessive risks. Do you want to make tens of thousands of dollars selling your deals? Become a Seller and publish your Signals!

### Over $1,000,000 in the Market of trading robots and applications

Every novice trader spends days and weeks in front of price charts in an attempt to unravel the nature of the market and create his or her own profitable trading strategy. In return, successful traders would gladly put a robot in charge of their trading activities if they could write the necessary program. Robots do not get tired, make no mistakes, never ask for money and do not suffer from human weaknesses. That is why algorithmic trading has become so popular and sought-after all over the world.

The [Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=visit.market.page) showcase features over 20,000 robots and trading applications, available for purchase and free download, by millions of traders directly in the MetaTrader terminal. A product can be purchased and installed in a few clicks. It is not bound to a trading account, while paid products have at least five activations. Activations [are not spent when using Market products in the built-in VPS](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1171?utm_campaign=0500.mql5.services.promo&utm_term=mql5.services.for.algotraders&utm_medium=article&utm_source=www.mql5.com&utm_content=learn.more), which can be rented as physically close to your broker's trading server as possible, thereby reducing network costs! This is critical for arbitrage and scalping-based strategies.

![Market of trading robots in the MetaTrader trading terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/41/3-market.png)

We have developed convenient services for programmers developing MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 applications who are willing to make a decent profit from selling their applications:

They're bots. They don't care if you crush their accounts or not. It's not the chain letter, it's the content.

It used to be spam mail, now it's bots to add friends. Both are selling bases) Cold aggression is cheap, but only effective in narrow correct settings. In the wrong ones, it can be negative.

Hi, This may be off topic as I am new to freelance.

Have put up my first order.

Get Developers box at the bottom of my order. Maybe the developer gives me a one sentence reply in comments.

In Freelance pages no Help button, no way of asking a moderator for knowledge.

So moderator rather than telling me I am off topic please answer these questions:

1   What do the % figures mean in the RH column of the developers box??

2   Developers have number of reviews quoted. How does a customer read these reviews??

In this article we will continue discussing the brute force approach. I will try to provide a better explanation of the pattern using the new improved version of my application. I will also try to find the difference in stability using different time intervals and timeframes.

In previous articles, we used stochastic gradient descent to train a neural network using the same learning rate for all neurons within the network. In this article, I propose to look towards adaptive learning methods which enable changing of the learning rate for each neuron. We will also consider the pros and cons of this approach.

This is the next article within the series, in which I show how I created a convenient library for manual application of chart graphics by utilizing keyboard shortcuts. The tools used include straight lines and their combinations. In this part, we will view how the drawing tools are applied using the functions described in the first part. The library can be connected to any Expert Advisor or indicator which will greatly simplify the charting tasks. This solution DOES NOT use external dlls, while all the commands are implemented using built-in MQL tools.

Thomas DeMark Sequential is good at showing balance changes in the price movement. This is especially evident if we combine its signals with a level indicator, for example, Murray levels. The article is intended mostly for beginners and those who still cannot find their "Grail". I will also display some features of building levels that I have not seen on other forums. So, the article will probably be useful for advanced traders as well... Suggestions and reasonable criticism are welcome...
