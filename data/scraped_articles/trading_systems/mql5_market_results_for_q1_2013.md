MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


Since its founding, [the store of trading robots and technical indicators](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "MQL5 Market - trading robots and custom technical indicators") MQL5 Market has already attracted more than 250 developers who have published 580 products including Expert Advisors (44% of the total number of applications), indicators (35%) and other applications.

The Market has been growing considerably during the first quarter of 2013. The number of downloads of free applications and demo versions of commercial products has almost doubled. As a result, the number of trading application downloads has reached 70 000 since [MQL5 Market launch](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/632 "MQL5 Market Turns One Year Old").

![Program Downloads Via MQL5 Market](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/mql5-market-download-trading-program-2013-1-en.png)

Sales volume of commercial products has also increased comprising 560 trading applications as of March 31, 2013. If we examine the growth dynamics during the previous quarters, we will see the following values. In quantitative terms, the average sales increase by 60% quarterly, while in money terms, the growth comprises 100% quarterly. Thus, the Market's total turnover for 2012 has already been exceeded in the first quarter of 2013.

![Program Purchases Via MQL5 Market](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/mql5-market-purchase-trading-program-2013-1-en.png)

The excess of money terms over the quantitative ones demonstrates demand of traders for expensive products. This can be seen on the chart of MQL5 Market's average purchase price. Moreover, we can see that the average purchase price of Expert Advisors is the first to increase comprising 170 US Dollars. This is well above the average price of panels (46 USD) and technical indicators (26 USD).

Distribution of sales by product category shows almost no changes. Expert Advisors and technical indicators are the most popular applications among MQL5 Market customers. They comprise 82% of total purchases and 94% of the store's overall turnover. Indicators are purchased most actively (45% of all applications), while Expert Advisors bring developers 90% of the overall profit.

**Vladon:**

Why film it? :-)

You don't need to film. not everyone is so stupid. there are adequate people who have read - tried - and bought. so it's OK. ;-)

The question is different - where to answer questions - if they are asked in the reviews, for example? there is no button to answer.

you know very well that reviews will not be enough for you too -- because then you will say, "I'm tired of answering the same thing.

**abolk:**

you realise that you won't get enough feedback either -- because then you'll be saying, "I'm sick of answering the same thing.

Chill out. It's enough for me to reply in a review or in a thread.

We will present a modified version of the Expert Advisor from the previous article "MQL5 Cookbook: Position Properties on the Custom Info Panel". Some of the issues we will address include getting data from bars, checking for new bar events on the current symbol, including a trade class of the Standard Library to a file, creating a function to search for trading signals and a function for executing trading operations, as well as determining trade events in the OnTrade() function.

The article covers everything you can do with strings in MQL5. It should be of interest primarily to novice MQL5 programmers, while experienced developers will have a good opportunity to summarize and systematize their knowledge.
