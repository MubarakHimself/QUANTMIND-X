MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


Another quarter of the year has passed and we have decided to sum up its results for [MetaTrader AppStore](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "MetaTrader AppStore - the online store of MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 trading robots and technical indicators") \- the largest store of trading robots and technical indicators for MetaTrader platforms.

First of all, AppStore for MetaTrader 4 has been released in [beta mode](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/13284 "MetaTrader 4 Market Released in Beta Mode!") and the final version is to be launched soon. However, trading robot developers can already publish their MQL4 applications there. More than 200 programs have already passed the tests. They will be available for traders immediately after MetaTrader 4 Market is launched.

More than 500 developers have placed over 1 200 products in MetaTrader AppStore by the end of the reported quarter. This exceeds [the previous quarter results](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/698 "MQL5 Market Results for Q2 2013") by one third. The largest share among the published applications is occupied by trading robots (45% of the total number of products) and technical indicators (34%). AppStore visitors can also purchase panels, analyzers and various utilities to expand the possibilities of their trading platform.

![MetaTrader Market: Range of Applications for MetaTrader 4/5](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/metatrader-appstore-range-applications-2013-3-en.png)

Along with the increase in the number of developers and products, the number of traders actively using the Market is also growing. The milestone of 150 000 downloads of trading robots and technical indicators has been reached in the third quarter. This number includes installations of free and commercial product versions since the launch of AppStore. The breakpoint of 100 000 downloads has also been passed just a little while ago - in the second quarter of this year.

### Sales

The sales of MetaTrader AppStore commercial products maintain a high growth rate (increased by 33% comparing with the previous quarter) and steadily increase in proportion with the number of downloads. This can be explained with the influx of new visitors to the AppStore and growing number of resales to the current clients - over 36% of buyers have purchased two or more AppStore products (+2% comparing with Q2 2013).

The third quarter has not brought any significant changes to the structure of sales by product categories. Technical indicators are still the most popular products in quantitative terms (45% of total products bought). Trading robots run a close second (41%). Panels occupy the third place with 6%.

![MetaTrader Market: Number of trading robots and indicators sold by category](https://c.mql5.com/2/6/metatrader-appstore-sales-amount-2013-3-en.png)

In monetary terms, trading robots (Expert Advisors) leave all other product types far behind. This product category occupies 85% in MetaTrader AppStore's total turnover. Trading robots are followed by indicators (9%) and panels (5%).

### MetaTrader AppStore TOP-10 Sellers

We have again prepared the list of TOP-10 Market sellers summarizing the results of Q3 2013. The list includes the best of 500 developers of trading robots and technical indicators with the highest sales volumes for the reported period.

TOP-10 MetaTrader AppStore sellers (Q3 2013):

01. [arnbober](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/arnbober/seller "MQL5.community profile of arnbober, developer of trading programs") (Arnold Bobrinskiy) - new on the top list

02. [johnnypasado](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/johnnypasado/seller "MQL5.community profile of johnnypasado, developer of trading programs") (Jeremy Scott)

03. [iTC](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/iTC/seller "MQL5.community profile of iTC, developer of trading programs") (Gennadiy Stanilevych)

04. [PzTrading](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/PzTrading/seller "MQL5.community profile of PzTrading, developer of trading programs") (Arturo Lopez Perez) - new on the top list

05. [cameuh](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/cameuh/seller "MQL5.community profile of cameuh, developer of trading programs") (Camille Huot) - new on the top list

06. [DC2008](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/DC2008/seller "MQL5.community profile of DC2008, developer of trading programs") (Sergey Pavlov) - new on the top list

07. [figurelli](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/figurelli/seller "MQL5.community profile of figurelli, developer of trading programs") (Rogerio Figurelli)

08. [mttruc](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/mttruc/seller "MQL5.community profile of mttruc, developer of trading programs") (Mai Thanh Truc) - new on the top list

09. [champions763](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/champions763/seller "MQL5.community profile of champions763, developer of trading programs") (Agus D Riadi) - new on the top list

10. [song\_song](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/song_song/seller "MQL5.community profile of song_song, developer of trading programs") (Jinsong Zhang) - new on the top list


For Q3 2013, the rating has changed significantly. First, we have a new leader - the newcomer [arnbober](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/arnbober/seller "View the profile of arnbober, developer of trading robots"). He has provided two products for sale - trading robots of [Bobra](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/1144 "Find out more about Bobra trading robot in AppStore") series. Both of them enjoy [popularity](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/10387 "Description of MetaTrader Market top products ranking system") and have good sales volumes. Second, our top list has as many as seven newcomers. They have entered the list while selling various products: trading robots, technical indicators, analyzers and utilities. For example, a seller [DC2008](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/DC2008/seller "View the profile of DC2008, developer of analyzers") sells only Analyzers.

The total sales of the TOP-10 sellers have comprised 39% of the overall amount of programs sold in Q3 2013. This is 4% less than in Q2 which can be explained by the growing number of sellers and sold Market applications. Our list of top sellers may change further after [AppStore for MetaTrader 4](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/mt4 "MetaTrader 4 Market – the store of applications for MetaTrader 4 trading platform") is officially launched. We will certainly follow up on this.

Prepare your MQL4/MQL5 applications for MetaTrader 4/5 and [sell](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/385 "How to Post a Product in MetaTrader AppStore") them on the multi-million market.

The article describes a method of modifying the code of a trading signal module for the implementation of the functionality allowing you to set pending orders at any distance from the current price: it may be the Close or Open price of the previous bar or the value of the moving average. There are plenty of options. Important is that you can set any opening price for a pending order. This article will be useful to traders who trade with pending orders.

We continue the series of articles on MQL5 programming. This time we will see how to get results of each optimization pass right during the Expert Advisor parameter optimization. The implementation will be done so as to ensure that if the conditions specified in the external parameters are met, the corresponding pass values will be written to a file. In addition to test values, we will also save the parameters that brought about such results.

Whatever trading strategy you use, there will always be a question of what parameters to choose to ensure future profits. This article gives an example of an Expert Advisor with a possibility to optimize multiple symbol parameters at the same time. This method is intended to reduce the effect of overfitting parameters and handle situations where data from a single symbol are not enough for the study.
