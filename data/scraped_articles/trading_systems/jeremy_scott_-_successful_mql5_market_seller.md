MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


Jeremy Scott who is better known under [Johnnypasado](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/johnnypasado/seller "Jeremy Scott's Nickname At MQL5.community") nickname at MQL5.community became famous offering products in our MQL5 Market service. He was an ordinary programmer providing free computing power to [MQL5 Cloud Network](https://cloud.mql5.com/ "The MQL5 Cloud Network Distributed Calculations System") and using the resources of this service to optimize his own applications. Forum and Jobs service were not his forte but he has managed to excel in another field.

![Jeremy Scott - Successful MQL5 Market Seller](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/jeremyscott_photo.jpg)

He has enjoyed wide popularity thanks to MQL5 Market - [online store offering trading robots and technical indicators](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "MQL5 Market - Trading Robots And Custom Technical Indicators"). Jeremy is one of the most profitable MQL5 Market developers widely known as the developer of Freak Expert Advisor series. As of March 10, these applications have been downloaded for 1845 and bought for 10 times in spite of high prices. The costs of Freak Expert Advisor series range from 875 up to 1379 credits depending on the version.

As a result, Jeremy has already made several thousands of dollars in the Market and that is not the limit. We are not going to evaluate the quality of the offered products but Jeremy's sales experience is extremely interesting. We decided to take a closer look at the future millionaire and receive some pieces of advice for MQL5 Market sellers.

### Seller's Expert Journey

Jeremy Scott is a successful sales person, actor, ballroom dance instructor and a polyglot but he is not intended to stop there. Already being familiar with programming in 2012, he discovered the development of trading robots for MetaTrader 5. Inspired by his knowledge and an energy drink, he developed such trading robots as "Alien Sandwich". Some of them have already left the Market, but obtained experience allowed the developer to create his most famous product - "Freak".

"I named it 'Freak' because I 'freaked out' with joy and happiness when I saw the results shown by my Expert Advisor in the tester! I mean, turning $100 into more than $10 million within two years is an excellent start!" - Jeremy told us.

Jeremy's outstanding results allowed him to gain popularity on MQL5 Market. He began publishing his programs on November 27 starting with Freak Free Version that can be launched on a real account with the trade volume of 0.01 lots. "I published the free version to allow traders to try and evaluate the trading strategy. This provides an honest test of robot's profitability on real accounts, as well as the possibility to discuss the issues with the seller before purchasing the application. Buyers appreciate honesty and transparency" - Jeremy says.

Along with the free version, Jeremy released the commercial product with the same name with no restrictions on trading volume. Later, he released another two commercial Expert Advisors of Freak series. The most advanced one features the trading parameters that were optimally matched by the developer. As a result, all Freak Expert Advisors have received the common trading strategy differing only in input parameter settings.

### Simple Tips from Jeremy

First, all Jeremy's Expert Advisors are provided with screenshots and videos containing inspiring results that all users can receive themselves when testing demo versions. According to Jeremy, this is the best type of advertising in MQL5 Market.

Second, "everyone knows that test results may be considerably different from real trading and that they should not be considered as a potential profit" - Jeremy says. Therefore, he offers free Freak Expert Advisor along with demo versions to allow users to trade on a real account. That helps traders to evaluate the strategy of commercial Freak Expert Advisors in real market and optimize input parameters depending on their brokers and symbols.

Third, Jeremy has prepared "The Freak Series Guide" designed to help buyers to optimize the Expert Advisor according to their particular conditions. Besides, such active communication with traders allows the developer to improve the trading strategy and receive feedbacks for further improvements. The best recommendations are considered and implemented in the Expert Advisors with each update.

Jeremy also recommends to actively use the means of the World Wide Web to attract clients: "Create your web site, add [MQL5 Market widgets](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/widgets "Add MQL5 Market Product Widgets To Your Blog") and offer free versions to your buyers. And do not forget to communicate with your customers actively and honestly". Considering that these simple recommendations have worked for one developer, they may work for you as well.

Hello Jeremy

Have just downloaded the demo - thank you for providing it; I will (as a complete newbie) be interested to see if I can install and make the correct settings...I expect I will be back within 24 hours with a cry (or more) for help~! I need to understand how to " [private message](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/24#personal_messages "MQL5.community - User Memo: Personal Messages")"

Keith

Hang back on the current version ;(  I messed something up along the update path and need to unify ideas from older versions in 2.0 and 3.0 series that are still trading well with a new filter.  I'll be testing all week to see if I get something good with this new filter!  The new version is working with some people, but I made the money management sensitive to leverage- and now the system is too risky, and one of the algorithms I tried to simplify (code-wise) must have hurt the system.  I'm working on it!  For anyone who reads this after I forgot I wrote it: if you see version 3x45, stay away from it, if it is 3.5 or higher (maybe 4.0 soon) then go ahead an use it!

I also made a system I think is better than Freak- as far as stability, random delay, and consistency goes, "Swing" that I'm offering all my customers, first to test on demo and make sure its bug free, then to test live.  When I have real money results, I will release the commercial version- Its very exciting EA that automatically adapts to markets with 2 main inputs only that is profitable 20 to 400 % year on all available instruments- much more adaptive and logical than Freak- I'm working on creating Freak 4.0 to be adaptive as well, but I'm afraid the strategy can't be made adaptable without loss of profitability.   Anyway just a heads up for what I'm working on at the moment. Best not to use the existing version (3x45) yet unless I get really stable results from customers using it.

Hi Jeremy

Thank you for the response and the update...I look forward to your future comments regarding the revised version of Freak and also the development of Swing; still haven't worked out the [private message](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/24#personal_messages "MQL5.community - User Memo: Personal Messages") her, but would like to make direct contact, if possible.

Oh yea I forgot to mention, the private message is simple, just click any name and it takes you to their profile, on the bottom right of whatever their picture is (some people have no big profile picture)  there is a "send message" in blue.  As a practice test, I'll wait until you contact me first before messaging you.

Hi,

I just can not get it baked. If he made USD 100, USD 10,000,000 with the EA in 2 years, why does he still have to earn money with the EA?

That's complete nonsense?

This contradicts the story.

We will present a modified version of the Expert Advisor from the previous article "MQL5 Cookbook: Position Properties on the Custom Info Panel". Some of the issues we will address include getting data from bars, checking for new bar events on the current symbol, including a trade class of the Standard Library to a file, creating a function to search for trading signals and a function for executing trading operations, as well as determining trade events in the OnTrade() function.

This time we will create a simple Expert Advisor that will get position properties on the current symbol and display them on the custom info panel during manual trading. The info panel will be created using graphical objects and displayed information will be refreshed at every tick. This is going to be much more convenient than all the time having to manually run the script described in the previous article of the series called "MQL5 Cookbook: Getting Position Properties".

Since its founding, the store of trading robots and technical indicators MQL5 Market has already attracted more than 250 developers who have published 580 products. The first quarter of 2013 has turned out to be quite successful for some MQL5 Market sellers who have managed to make handsome profit by selling their products.

Arrays are an integral part of almost any programming language along with variables and functions. The article should be of interest primarily to novice MQL5 programmers, while experienced programmers will have a good opportunity to summarize and systematize their knowledge.
