MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


### Freelance for algo traders

[MQL5 Freelance](https://www.mql5.com/en/job) is a specialized service for trading application developers. Traders come here when they need custom-made trading robots, indicators, and other utility apps developed in MQL5/MQL4, Python, C++, and other modern programming languages.

The MQL5.com Freelance service [was launched](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/1211) in June 2010 and has, over the 14 years of its existence, provided professional developers with the opportunity to generate profits. As of June 2024, the service has over 100,000 projects completed to date, totaling $7 million in value.

Over the past 14 years, 54,000 developers have undertaken the creation of trading programs, with 25,000 clients satisfied with their work. A developer actively working on the Freelance platform can earn several thousand dollars per month. You can earn just as much.

Your potential clients include millions of traders using MetaTrader platforms, as they access the Freelance service directly from their terminals.

![Freelance from the MetaTrader 5 terminal](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/MetaTrader_Freelance_EN.gif)

### Streamlined workflows

The service provides [well-designed functionality](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/117), allowing you to focus on the main task: selecting suitable orders and submitting applications with estimated deadlines and costs. All work processes are performed within the service, ensuring your interests are protected: you receive the job from the customer, complete it, and receive payment right here. This mechanism is convenient and safe, allowing you to focus without distractions.

Freelance projects are divided into stages, each recorded in the system:

![Stages of Freelance projects](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/sheme-freelance-II-En.png)

Both the developer and the customer are required to confirm every step. Agree on the order terms, and the technical specifications, and finalize the agreement. The relevant funds will be automatically reserved on the client's account.

Once the customer accepts the delivered solution, **the system will automatically transfer the reserved funds to the developer's account**.

All orders are displayed on the [service's main page](https://www.mql5.com/en/job). You can sort them by creation date, cost or project name:

![All orders are displayed on the service's main page](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/orders_EN.png)

Choose a suitable order, specify the timeline and budget, and submit your application:

![Submit our application](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/submit_application_EN.png)

Current job applications are visible to all users of MQL5.community, but all applicants remain anonymous. Each application shows the developer rating, statistics on executed orders, and current workload.

Do not forget to scroll down and check the "Similar Orders" sections, as you might find more suitable orders here:

![Do not forget to scroll down and check the "Similar Orders" sections](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/similar_orders_EN.png)

**Get Seller status** to take on freelance orders on MQL5.com. [Request Seller status](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/385#register_as_seller) and start earning through MQL5 services.

You already know how to work with customers, and you might have completed some orders. Remember, you are not the only developer applying for freelance jobs.

### How to maximize your income

2. Make sure to specify your [MetaQuotes ID](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/476) in your profile to receive timely notifications. With the MetaQuotes ID added to your profile, you will receive notifications about important events:

4. Many developers focus on [English-language orders](https://www.mql5.com/en/job "Freelance orders in other languages"), while there are job postings in different languages. To take on such orders, you can use the built-in translator to communicate in any language.




![Built-in translator](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/2024-06-07_14h41_45__1.gif)


6. Improve your profile

   - **List your advantages** as a freelancer, upload a good profile picture, and choose a high-quality cover image.
   - **Describe previously completed projects** and share interesting experiences in your feed.

These details will catch the eye of potential clients, increasing the likelihood of being chosen for personal projects.

![Freelancer profile](https://c.mql5.com/2/174/profile_description_EN.png)

7. Ask customers to leave fair reviews of your work. You can be sure that a well-executed project will always receive positive feedback. Such reviews help traders choose the most suitable developer from the many applications.

Another thing to consider: [English-language applications](https://www.mql5.com/en/job "Orders in English in Freelance"). ... and with an in-built translator at your service that allows you to communicate in any language.

The inbuilt translator is specific -- work [https://www.mql5.com/en/job/215046:](https://www.mql5.com/en/job/215046)

Обратите внимание на ваш профиль.

- **Write about yourself**, your key skills and your involvement in various projects.
- **List your advantages** as a  contractor, upload a good avatar and put a high-quality picture on the cover.
- **Describe already completed orders** or  just interesting cases from practice on your wall.

All this will draw the attention of a potential customer who may choose you for personalised work.

_I wonder, - for personal work he can choose you, but when NOT personal work - he chooses a developer blindly? You can't refer to your own work?_

### Conducting orders bypassing the "Freelance" service

1. The "Freelance" service may only be used for its intended purpose - to carry out all work and calculations within the published Orders. Searching for customers or performers in the "Freelance" service to perform work on the side is prohibited and is a violation of the Rules.

2. **Customers and Applicants are forbidden to** exchange contact information of any kind before the conclusion of the Work Agreement. Violation leads to a ban on participation in Freelance.
3. It **is forbidden to perform work and make payments for** Orders placed in Freelance **outside the framework of this service**. Violation leads to the denial of access to all services of the MQL5.com website.

4. The Administration may, as a result of an internal investigation, deprive the violator of the right to participate in the "Freelance" service without explanation.

**Aleh Sasonka [#](https://www.mql5.com/ru/forum/33868#comment_58788156):**

The confusion arises because the phrase "show experience" is perceived by many people as references to external works or contacts.

But in Freelance, experience means only what is inside MQL5: profile, order history, reviews.

The rule prohibits external links and communication outside the platform until the confirmation of the task.

Therefore, this is not a contradiction, but just different things that are often confused.

But in Freelance, experience means only what is inside MQL5: profile, order history, feedback.

The rule prohibits external links and communication outside the platform until the confirmation of the task.

.

I cannot agree. Before the conclusion of the Agreement on Work, you cannot provide links to any of your MQL5 resources in your messages: neither your profile, nor publications in Codebase, nor blogs, nor signals. That is, nothing that will help the customer understand who exactly responded to his order. If the customer creates a non-personalised work, he must choose the performer blindly. The customer will not know who exactly is the responding developer he has chosen until the Job Agreement is signed.

I say this from my own experience. When in one of the responses to an order I provided a link to my code in Codebase, I got my account blocked.

This article continues the topic of predicting the upcoming price movement. I invite you to get acquainted with the Multi-future Transformer architecture. Its main idea is to decompose the multimodal distribution of the future into several unimodal distributions, which allows you to effectively simulate various models of interaction between agents on the scene.

The models we create are becoming larger and more complex. This increases the costs of not only their training as well as operation. However, the time required to make a decision is often critical. In this regard, let us consider methods for optimizing model performance without loss of quality.
