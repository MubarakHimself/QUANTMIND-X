MetaTrader 5 / Examples


All beginning traders start their learning journey with the technical analysis basics, and many of them read the same books on stock exchange trading. The basics are normally easy to understand. However, the initial manual trading phase passes fairly quickly. The next step is to achieve greater stability of trading results and to increase trading volumes, while covering a variety of financial instruments and maintaining low risk. This is where algorithmic trading via trading robots comes in handy, which is however a totally new area of study. In addition to financial market knowledge, it requires programming and technical analysis skills.

The algorithmic trading topic is too broad. By simply searching on the web, you can find hundreds or even thousands of specialized resources and tutorials. One of the approaches which is becoming increasingly popular concerns Machine Learning and Neural Networks. This is a whole new area of diverse knowledge, and thus it can be difficult to understand where to start learning this subject. We have prepared a selection of materials in English in order to save you time searching for this information.

## News and Sentiment Trading

There is a constant increase in the amount of news broadcast by various news agencies. The application of filters was required in order to benefit from this data stream therefore this feature was mainly used by the research departments of large investment firms. However, with the advent of news content digitization, developing computational capabilities and linguistic methods of interpretation, this data can now be analyzed efficiently and quickly. The programs that analyze this data are most commonly referred to as Sentiment Algorithms.

Natural language based financial forecasting: a survey ( [Link](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://sentic.net/natural-language-based-financial-forecasting.pdf "http://sentic.net/natural-language-based-financial-forecasting.pdf")). The availability of data and various techniques leads to the qualitative development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This increasing ability enables a more accurate capture of market sentiment.

This article describes Hybrid Attention Networks, which are intended to predict stock trends based on a sequence of recent related events.

This article describes how to create trading strategies using

machine learning methods for both technical analysis indicators and market sentiment. The described forecasting models can be used as algorithmic trading on any given stock exchange.

Deep Learning for Event-Driven Stock Prediction ( [Link](https://www.mql5.com/go?link=http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/download/11031/10986 "http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/download/11031/10986")). The article discusses Deep Learning methods for event-driven stock market prediction. First, events are extracted from the news text and are represented as dense vectors that are trained using a novel neural tensor network. Next, a deep convolutional neural network is used to model both short-term and long-term influences of events on stock price movements.


## Conclusion

The purpose of this article is to provide traders with a brief, useful summary of publicly available machine learning tutorials. We hope that even a beginner will find something useful for themselves and get an insight of further development ideas. Some of the presented materials might require additional knowledge that goes far beyond a simple understanding of technical indicators and programming skills.

If any of the subjects seem too complicated, now you know which courses to look for on the web in order to master the machine learning area. Learn something new, assist other traders, share links and your ideas in this complicated yet interesting area, via our MQL5.community.

**Ilnur Hasanov [#](https://www.mql5.com/ru/forum/426646#comment_40083161):**

I've seen a lot of these types of machines. And not one in profit it didn't work. Machine learning. Okay, that's a nice word. Artificial intelligence. When you look at this artificial intelligence, you realise it's not intelligence at all. So is there a real working algorithm based on AI that trades for profit? Even a person with real intelligence makes mistakes.

It seems that [my solution](https://www.mql5.com/ru/blogs/post/746398) is the only one that really works out of everything that is available in MQL5. So far it is only an indicator, but I am not in a hurry, in time I will have a trading bot.

I haven't updated the models for a long time, the new version for crypto shows good results, but I haven't posted it here.

Thanks for the links.

Maybe someone can recommend where is the best place to start diving into the topic? Where did those who are now well versed in ML start (especially if not originally trained as data scientists)?

Start by looking at Python courses.There are a lot of them now and there are even free ones, I think.

You can't get into machine learning without it.

Todays trader is a philomath who is almost always (either consciously or not...) looking up new ideas, trying them out, choosing to modify them or discard them; an exploratory process that should cost a fair amount of diligence. This clearly places a premium on the trader's time and the need to avoid mistakes. These series of articles will proposition that the MQL5 wizard should be a mainstay for traders. Why? Because not only does the trader save time by assembling his new ideas with the MQL5 wizard, and greatly reduce mistakes from duplicate coding; he is ultimately set-up to channel his energy on the few critical areas of his trading philosophy.
