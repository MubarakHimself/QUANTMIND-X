MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


Successfully operating for 1.5 years, MQL5 Market has become the largest traders' [store of trading strategies and technical indicators](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "MQL5 Market - the online store of MetaTrader 5 trading robots and technical indicators"). It offers around 800 trading applications provided by 350 developers from around the world. 80% of all programs are Expert Advisors and indicators. Traders can also benefit from various panels, analyzers and utility programs that allow you to add extra functionality to the [MetaTrader 5](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/automated-trading/mql5market "MetaTrader 5 - the trading platform for working on financial markets") trading terminal.

Developers try to impress traders with a variety of products offered in a wide price range. Both free (19% of the total programs offered) and commercial products with prices from 10 to over 1 000 US Dollars are now available to buyers.

In only 6 quarters of MQL5 Market operation, traders have bought and downloaded to their MetaTrader 5 terminals more than 100.000 trading applications. Downloads of free programs and demo versions of commercial products were about equal in number. Summarizing the results for Q2 2013, the number of downloads via MQL5 Market has increased by 30% as compared to the previous quarter.

![MQL5 Market: Increased downloads of trading robots and technical indicators for the MetaTrader 5 platform](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/mql5-market-download-trading-program-2013-2-en.png)

Looking at the breakdown of purchases by category of products available in MQL5 Market, we find the following: In quantitative terms, technical indicators take the leadership with 41% share in total purchases. However, their share has decreased by 4% compared to the [previous quarter](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/670 "MQL5 Market Results for Q2 2013"). Further, we see a strong growing demand for trading robots. The share of Expert Advisors is almost as high as that of indicators, now reaching 40% (3% increase compared to the previous quarter).

![MQL5 Market: number of trading application sold via MQL5 Market by category](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/mql5-market-sales-amount-2013-2-en.png)

In terms of money, the breakdown of sales by product category looks somewhat different. Trading robots take the lead with impressive 84%. It has to do with the fact that the average price of Expert Advisors is usually higher than that of other products.

![MQL5 Market: sales volume of trading strategies and indicators by category](https://c.mql5.com/2/5/mql5-market-sales-volume-2013-2-en.png)

High quality, expensive products for automated trading in financial markets are still in demand. This is where active developers take advantage of the situation. They monitor customer requests and post the relevant trading applications right when they are required.

### MQL5 Market TOP-10 Sellers

Summarizing the results for Q2 2013, we have prepared a new list of TOP-10 MQL5 Market developers.

The first six developers on the list are the same as in the [list prepared for the previous quarter report](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/670 "List of top sellers of trading applications for Q1 2013"), whereas the last four names are new.

The total sales of the TOP-10 sellers have reached 43% of all MQL5 Market programs in Q2. The most profitable seller is the developer known as [johnnypasado.](https://www.mql5.com/en/users/johnnypasado "MQL5.community profile of johnnypasado, seller of trading robots and indicators") While being third on the previous TOP-10 list, he has now taken the lead. It looks like his [sales strategy](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/665 "Jeremy Scott's MQL5 Market sales strategy") is 100% successful.

Please note that at the end of the reporting period, we launched a [new reward scheme for attracting users](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/12638 "Reward scheme for attracting MQL5.community users to promote affiliate web links"). It is intended for assisting developers in promoting their trading programs. Each seller can now find promoters among MQL5.community users who will post affiliate web links to relevant products for a certain reward. Thus, sellers can attract trader's attention to their programs and increase sales volumes. It may well be that the chance to hit the next TOP-10 list will be in direct relation to the extent of seller's participation in the affiliate program launched.

Post your best products, set reasonable prices and attract traders using the [new reward scheme for attracting users](https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/12638 "MQL5.community: reward scheme for attracting users to promote trading program and signals").

personally, my sales are up about three times what they were last quarter. I'm talking about quantity.

**iTC:**

Rather, we need to shed light on the methodology of calculating the TOP.

And the methodology is simple - the one who has made the most turnover is the one who is higher.

I've announced my figure (though I'm in a modest 10th place), let's wait for more volunteers.

Quantity has nothing to do with it, it's the amount.

Question for me?

What is social trading? It is a mutually beneficial cooperation of traders and investors whereby successful traders allow monitoring of their trading and potential investors take the opportunity to monitor their performance and copy trades of those who look more promising.

It's not just simple; it's super simple. Testing Expert Advisors on non-standard time frames is possible! All we need to do is to replace standard time frame data with non-standard time frame data. Furthermore, we can even test Expert Advisors that use data from several non-standard time frames.

External variables of indicators are controlled using a special window where parameters can be changed and the indicator is then run again. The obvious inconvenience of these manipulations has given rise to the need for displaying the required parameters on the screen and controlling the indicator graphically.

It has been over a year since MQL5 started providing native support for OpenCL. However not many users have seen the true value of using parallel computing in their Expert Advisors, indicators or scripts. This article serves to help you install and set up OpenCL on your computer so that you can try to use this technology in the MetaTrader 5 trading terminal.
