[What's wrong with regular VPS?Here are the 8 most common problems that algorithmic traders may encounterRead![](https://www.mql5.com/ff/sh/hzatb686qjqxwtr4z2/01.png)](https://www.mql5.com/ff/go?link=https://www.mql5.com/en/forum/450486&a=drhremihlwuaqyvgpzfddbtmgciejpba&s=c37d25bcceb93ed153b814e6ba4d4839461a9b2d68dd82b95b142be06d310f3f&uid=&ref=https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1009&id=bfogggabsofabcpxuzmgaibarmaxasdrj&fz_uniq=5083206194459317998)

MetaTrader 5 / Trading systems


Algorithmic trading becomes more popular and needed, which naturally led to a demand for exotic algorithms and unusual tasks.

Today, MACD or Bollinger Bands based EAs are not the only ones sought
after. Traders now crave for more complex and unique applications
performing market analysis from different points of view. That is
understandable: the more signals an algorithm produces, the more
reliable a trade will be.

![Orders for development of Unique Expert Advisors and Technical Indicators](https://c.mql5.com/2/10/MQL5_freelance_01.png)

To some extent, such complex applications are available in the [Code Base](https://www.mql5.com/en/code "Source code library - Expert Advisors, Indicators and Scripts")
or in the [Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "Market of Trading Robots for MetaTrader"). Although traders have simple access to those apps in a
couple of clicks, these apps may not satisfy all needs in full. In this
case, traders look for developers who can write a desired application
in the MQL5 Freelance section and assign an order. Just [like this](https://www.mql5.com/en/job/16492 "Order for Expert Advisor"):

**![Order for Expert Advisor](https://c.mql5.com/2/10/MQL5_freelance_02_en.png)**

Generally speaking, this kind of order is pretty ordinary and
straightforward in terms of programming, but it requires the developer
to create a unique EA for the specific trader. Apparently, for the
customer it is more convenient to work with such an expert and he is
willing to pay for the job. There are many orders as such in the [Freelance](https://www.mql5.com/en/job "Freelance at MQL5.com - Orders for development of Expert Advisors and technical indicators")
section, and this is a great opportunity to gain income through
Freelance jobs in a short time, solving an interesting and unique
challenge.

In many instances traders don't need to develop an application from
scratch, but require to make some changes in the existing code. In other
words, a trader can have an EA or an indicator in which [something is not quite right](https://www.mql5.com/en/job/16375). For example, it lacks an indicator to receive more reliable signals, or money management concepts need to be changed.

**![Technical Indicator Update](https://c.mql5.com/2/10/MQL5_freelance_02_en__2.png)**

A decent number of such orders can also be found in the Freelance
section. Of course, those orders are of lower cost, but also require
less work - it's not too bad to get $50 for an hour's work. In addition,
you can perform several orders simultaneously, and total earnings may
be quite impressive.

**Underrated Market of Custom Applications**

In broader terms of algorithmic trading, the statistics in the [Code \\
Base](https://www.mql5.com/en/code "Source code library - Expert Advisors, Indicators and Scripts") and the [Market](https://www.mql5.com/en/market "Market of Trading Robots for MetaTrader") clearly demonstrate that trading robots themselves
become more interesting for traders. At the same time, the Freelance
analysis indicates that more traders need the services from developers
to meet unique one-time challenges.

For the last 4 years, the service accommodated about 3,000 traders
for whom more than 10,000 orders have been performed. The pace of
creating new orders is constantly growing, so we can safely proclaim
that this is a new emerging market of custom applications. Like in every
market, this one also has its own volume - almost $600,000 spread over
developers' purses. [Top developers](https://www.mql5.com/en/job/developers "TOP Freelance developers accomplished the most of the orders") performing orders on a regular basis received the most of this amount.

However, during this time only 281 developers created custom
programs. The Freelance remained in the shadow of more streamlined
services, and many developers avoided it by mistake, believing that it
was not a serious source for their income. In the contrary, top
freelance developers earn as much as the top sellers in the Market do!

In addition, working in the Freelance gives a good programming
practice, since tasks are constantly varying and must be resolved within
a limited timeframe. Lastly, developers can establish a name for
themselves as professional developers and earn even more, so that
traders on their own will choose to assign personalized orders to them
by name. Besides, such a name will give an additional benefit if if such
a professional decides to become a seller or a signal provider!

We have created the Freelance service with an idea to support a small
number of traders who needed services from developers. After 4 years,
the number of such traders has drastically increased, and they are ready
to pay top dollar for their orders. If you're a developer, and you are
not on MQL5, you are seriously missing out!

Yup a very convenient and proper arrangement I think - just getting ready to use it for the first time but I think (from all I have read, heard and seen about it) it will be worth it. One thing though I think the service desk might be more responsive. I had a little problem funding my account and though solved it by myself now, at first I tried to reach service desk/support but for two days no help, then I called Cyprus and still only got a machine response saying I should write support and I did but no support. Anyway just to point out that with growing usage of the freelance service there should be more visible and responsive support from the service desk staff as there will always be issues - mostly very simple ones like mine for first timers.

On the occasion of the MQL5 Freelance Service fourth birthday, we have prepared an info-graphic demonstrating the service results for the entire time of its existence. The figures speak for themselves: more than 10 000 orders worth about $600,000 in total have been executed to date, while 3 000 customers and 300 developers have already used the service.

Today we will learn how to link an MetaTrader 5 terminal with Twitter so that you can tweet your EAs' trading signals. We are developing a Social Decision Support System in PHP based on a RESTful web service. This idea comes from a particular conception of automatic trading called computer-assisted trading. We want the cognitive abilities of human traders to filter those trading signals which otherwise would be automatically placed on the market by the Expert Advisors.

So Why Would We Change It?"](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1045)

Let us reveal a little secret: MQL5.com website visitors spend most of their time on Johnpaul77 signal's page. It is a leader of our signal rating having about 900 subscribers with the total funds of $5.7 million on real accounts. We have interviewed the signal's providers. As it turned out, there are four of them! How are duties distributed among the team members? What technical tools do they use? Why do they call themselves John Paul? And finally, how have common gamers from Indonesia become providers of the top signal on MQL5.com? Find out all that in the article.

The article describes an example of Renko charting and its implementation in MQL5 as an indicator. Modifications of this indicator distinguish it from a classic chart. It can be constructed both in the indicator window and on the main chart. Moreover, there is the ZigZag indicator. You can find a few examples of the chart implementation.
