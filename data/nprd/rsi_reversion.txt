"Transcript: Strategy - RSI Mean Reversion V1
Goal: Create a simple bot that buys when market is oversold and sells when overbought.
Entry: Buy if RSI(14) crosses below 30 and then back above. Sell if RSI(14) crosses above 70 and then back below.
Risk: Use 50 pip stop loss and 100 pip take profit.
Physics: Ensure it uses the new Strategy Router and Kelly scaling. If chaos is high, reduce size.
Target: EURUSD M15."
