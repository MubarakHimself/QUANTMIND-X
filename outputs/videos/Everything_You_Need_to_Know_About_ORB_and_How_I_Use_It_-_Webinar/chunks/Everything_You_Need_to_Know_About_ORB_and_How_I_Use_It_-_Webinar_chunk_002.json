I don't care about any earnings reports. I don't want to know nothing. All I want to know is live price action when the markets are open, because what do we tend to do? How many of you are guilty of this? You saw an earnings report, you saw a big move overnight. We're up 250 points and you said, man, this thing's going to dump. People are going to take profit right at 9:30. I'm going short right at the open. There's no way it can keep going up. 9:30 opens and you see the biggest green candle you've ever seen. You went from 250 to 350 green and you cooked yourself. Why? Why?",
