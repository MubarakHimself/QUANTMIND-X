# This command runs a shell script wrapper (or direct python) to orchestrate
# 1. Download/Extract (Python)
# 2. Feed to Gemini (via prompt context injection)

# NOTE: Since we cannot easily "inject" dynamic file paths into a static TOML prompt from a shell command output within the TOML syntax itself easily without a custom tool, 
# we will design this command to output the INSTRUCTIONS for the user/server on what to do, OR we rely on the Server to handle the orchestration.
# However, to make it useful:

prompt = """
You are about to analyze a video from {{url}}.
First, I need to get the video data.

Please run the 'nprd_preprocess' tool (if available) or wait for my data injection.

(Note: For full automation, use the NPRD Server API which handles the file uploading automatically).
